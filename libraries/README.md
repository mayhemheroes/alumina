## Libraries

Contains various reusable Alumina libraries that do not belong in the standard library but are still needed by tools in this repo.
Once `bauxite` (i.e. `cargo`) is ready, these will be published as separate repos probably.

- [./tree_sitter](./tree_sitter) - Language bindings for the Tree-Sitter library
- [./json](./json) - JSON parser and serializer
- [./aluminac](./aluminac) - A library for working with Alumina source code (eventually will be the basis for `aluminac`)
